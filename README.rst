_________________

`ZSHPower` is a theme for ZSH; especially for the `Python`_ developer. Pleasant to look at, the **ZSHPower** comforts you with its colors and icons vibrant.

Installing **ZSHPower** is the easiest thing you will see in any existing theme for **ZSH**, because there is a manager.

The changes in the theme become more dynamic through a configuration file, where the user can make various combinations for the style of **ZSHPower**.

The **ZSHPower** supports installation along with `Oh My ZSH`_, where changes to: **enable** and **disable** an `Oh My ZSH`_ theme are easier, all in a simplified command line, without opening any files or creating symbolic links.

In addition, the **ZSHPower** manager downloads **Oh My Zsh** and the
`zsh-autosuggestions`_ and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`_ plugins automatically, everything to make your ZSH very power.
